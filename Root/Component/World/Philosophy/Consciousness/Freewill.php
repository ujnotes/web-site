      Are we 'free', to think and decide?
      Or is it that we are merely acting out the choices that have already been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      A noteworthy example is of two calculators of the exact same make. If you turn them on and ask them to generate random numbers, they both will generate same numbers in sequence.
      <!-- It turns out we are just -->
    </p>
    <p>
      The question is: if we were begin a simulation of 'existance' with the exactly same initial state of our world, could we, without altering anything thing midway,
      in that simiulation reach the exact state as that of the present reality?<br>
      If so then we could conclude that there is no free will; only its illusion.
