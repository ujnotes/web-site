		<h3>What is freewill?</h3>
		<p>
			Freewill is the ability of determine the independent of prior events.<br>
			E.g. imagine a bowling pins.. the way the pins fall is determined by the what happens prior to they fall.<br>
			If we have all the required information, we can predict exactly what will happen next.<br>
			If a pin was free to decide how it wants to fall, it would have freewill<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Do we have freewill?</h3>
		<p>
			Are we 'free', to think and decide and choose?
			Or is it that we are merely acting out the choices that have already been made.
		</p>
		<p>
			A noteworthy example is of two calculators of the exact same make. If you turn them on and ask them to generate random numbers, they both will generate same numbers in sequence.<br>
			<!-- It turns out we are just -->
		</p>
		<p>
			The question is: if we were begin a simulation of 'existence' with the exactly same initial state of our world, could we, without altering anything thing midway,
			in that simulation reach the exact state as that of the present reality?<br>
			If so then we could conclude that there is no free will; only its illusion.

		<h3>What is the morality of punishment</h3>
		<h3>Should we then worry of the outcomes</h3>
