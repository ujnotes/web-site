			Death is the irreversible loss of life.<br>
			The body that supports the life at some point can no longer sustain itself and ceases to function.<br>
			In the absence of a process that could mirror and preserve the state of a mind, the end of the body leads to the end of the personality.<br>
			But of course some aspects of the personality transcend death in the form of memories, art and literature, children, work etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			After death, personally nothing special happens. It is quite like taking off the battery from a toy.<br>
			The 'false' idea of a personal afterlife is born from the human instinct of wanting to live at 'any' cost.<br>
			In order to support this fallacy many subscribe to the next fallacy of the existence of a heaven and a personal god that overlooks this entire affair.
		</P>
		<p>
			Seeking to have a personal legacy even after death, is indeed one of mans' most ludicrous idea.<br>
			The only legacy that a person should have, should be an impersonal one that inspires the future generation to goodness.<br>
			Recycling one's dead body should be done in the most environment friendly way that has the smallest footprint and gives back to the world.<br>
			Organ donation should be considered.

      "Death is the single best invention of life"<br>
      &nbsp; &mdash; Steve Jobs

    <p>
      The old must leave to make space for the new.<br>
      This is a critical tool that nature employs to make evolution happen.<br>
      And see where we are; well at least the good aspects.

			Death is a natural equalizer. It dynamically maintains the delicate relationships of the ecosystem<br>
			If only we were to control our population growth rate, we could turn around the environmental destruction of our mother planet within a century.
		</p>
		<p>
			Death teaches us the futility of material possessions and self-centeredness.<br>
			It is also something that we share with the rest of the world. Trees die, animals die just as us humans.
		</p>
		<p>
      Remember, death is but only a part of life.<br>
			Learn and understand. Let not its fear - not let you live.
