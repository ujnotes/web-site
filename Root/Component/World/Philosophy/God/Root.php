      Just as different students might assume different names like x and y for the same unknown of the same question; I think different religions in this same manner name their ‘gods’ differently.
      However we all face the same problem - we are in the same quest of finding that same ‘unknown’.

      One student may say: "let that be x", the other might say: "let the same be y". similarly Hinduism let that be Vishnu; Islam let that be Allah.
      Truth is we are all still looking for the same answer.

      Effectively, from my experiences so far, I have not observed any existance of a supernatural entity altering the world.
      Thus, I do not believe in a personal god.
      God is but a symbol. God represents the ‘good’.
      Unfortunately for most, God is an idea lost in translation
    </p>
    <p>
      Our fear of death, our need for a 'meaning', a higher cause has given birth to the idea of a personal god, a second life, heaven and hell.

      People want to believe in a god because they want to be ‘special’
    </p>

      If all became atheists overnight, how would it change the world
