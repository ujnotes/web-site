			What is a problem?
		</h3>
		<p>
			A matter or situation that is impeding or harmful and thus needing to be resolved.
		</p>
		<h3>
			The problems of this world:
		</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Ignorance and stupidity of man</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Things like crime, poverty, hunger, environmental destruction and animal cruelty are mostly but a consequence of the first problem.<br>
			And the rest, like cancer and death are only 'realities'. If curable they are only 'tasks' to be accomplished.<br>
			Which again are impeded by the first problem.
		</p>
		<h3>
			&diams;
		</h3>
		<p>
			Man, by his nature seeks to control and thus dominate what is around him.<br>
			And so, many simply 'like' to discriminate and kill.<br>
			Now that our civilization is thousands of years old, we already have the knowledge, the resources and the tools.<br>
			Yet man wants to remain selfish even though it is understood, how futile and limited his personal life is.<br>
			Because of this, he continues to 'waste' his life on trivial things; Often hurting others on his way.<br>
			Due to his hunger for 'more' and his eccentricity, that wanting of being 'special' - he is readily sold to irrational ideas.<br>
			He thus often subscribes to the idea of a personal 'god' that 'cares' about him 'personally'.<br>
			Racism and sectarianism rise from the same selfish craving of wanting to stand above the rest and dominate.<br>
			The structure of our societies and its economy exploit and thus promote this eccentric behavior.<br>
			While morality is often compromised over personal gains, life is reduced to sell and buy then show and throw and its repetition.<br>
			At the level of sects, races and then countries this eccentricity continues and periodically results in violent eruptions.<br>
			Even to this day, world peace dangles precariously on the prospect of mutually assured destruction.<br>
			<br>
			All because man refuses to learn and embrace what has already been learnt.
