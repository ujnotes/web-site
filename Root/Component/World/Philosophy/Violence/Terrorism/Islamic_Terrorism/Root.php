      Why Muslims?
      I do not think that ‘Islam’ is the root cause of terrorism. Unfortunately due to the highly volatile conditions in the Islamic region it is perceived that Islam is the problem.
      In the early days the middle east was a very harsh environment. Since there was no oil to be traded and supplies would be in very short supply. This would automatically and naturally transcend into higher violence that also tainted the religion of the region.
      To date the disparity amongst the ruling and the ruled and the violent oppression has remained in much of the region.

      I think it is not a problem of the religion but that of the region.

			to be Islam and mostly all new terrorist that show up happen to be ‘muslims’. It's just rebellious, cool and in vogue! And I am sure even if there was no Islam there would still be just as many terrorists only attaching another religious label to themselves.

      The recent turmoil in Syria was ignited by a severe drought after years of disparate governance.

      As far as I understand all religions seek to emphasize the non-significance of an individual over that of the society. That no matter how great you become, that no matter how special you are are you will not be the special ‘one’, you can never be God. That being selfish is only foolish. So most importantly we need educate ourselves into understanding the true meaning of what has been written in those holy books and not just get lost in the abstractions and rituals of it.
      I request you all to get off the path of mindless
