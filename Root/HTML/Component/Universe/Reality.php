		Why is there something instead of nothing?<br>
		The key to the answer of this question may lie in the fact that there is both 'something' and 'nothing' and both are a requisite for each other.<br>
		i.e. one cannot exist without the possibility of the other; there cannot be nothing if there cannot be something and vice-versa.
	</p>
	<p>
		Beside this: the distance between two separate 'somethings' and relative positions of these makes up 'space'.<br>
		The different configuration of these make time.<br>
