	<h2 class='center'>Understanding 'I' - the consciousness</h2>
	<p>
		We are a part of this world, and made of the same matter as the rest of it. Yet there is something profoundly different about us.<br>
		We are the living and thinking ones. Conscious and aware of our own existence. We 'decide' and choose our actions.<br>
		All thanks to our complex brains<br>
		But are we really that 'special', are we really that 'free'?<br>
	<h3>Thoughts</h3>
	<p>
		A thought is a virtual partial simulation of reality. Evolution devised it for survival.<br>
		E.g. a sound of the _ of dried leaves triggers a thought of being prayed by a larger predator thereby making the individual more active and less prone to becoming someone's snack.<br>
	</p>
	<h3>Self awareness</h3>
	<p>
		A system capable of thoughts that is aware of its own existence in that it knows of its physical extents.
		
	</p>
	<h3>Consciousness</h3>
	<p>
		Being able to think what to think.
