	<h3>
		What is death?
	</h3>
	<p>
		Death is the irreversible loss of life.<br>
		The body that supports the life at some point can no longer sustain itself and ceases to function.<br>
		In the absence of a process that could mirror and preserve the state of a mind, the end of the body leads to the end of the personality.<br>
		But of course some aspects of the personality transcend death in the form of memories, art and literature, children, work etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Death is the single best invention of life"<br>
		&nbsp; &mdash; Steve Jobs
	</p>
	<p>
		The old must leave to make space for the new.<br>
		This is a critical tool that nature employs to make evolution happen.<br>
		And see where we are; well at least the good aspects.
	</p>
	<p>
		Death is a natural equalizer. It dynamically maintains the delicate relationships of the ecosystem<br>
		If only we were to control our population growth rate, we could turn around the environmental destruction of our mother planet within a century.
	</p>
	<h3>
		What happens after death?
	</h3>
	<p>
		After death, personally nothing special happens. It is quite like taking off the battery from a toy.<br>
		The 'false' idea of a personal afterlife is born from the human instinct of wanting to live at 'any' cost.<br>
		In order to support this fallacy many subscribe to the next fallacy of the existence of a heaven and a personal god that overlooks this entire affair.
	</P>
	<p>
		Seeking to have a personal legacy even after death, is indeed one of mans' most ludicrous idea.<br>
		The only legacy that a person should have, should be an impersonal one that inspires the future generation to goodness.
	</p>
	<h3>
		How to deal with death?
	</h3>
	<p>
		Death teaches us the futility of material possessions and self-centeredness.<br>
		It is also something that we share with the rest of the world. Trees die, animals die - just as us humans, rich or poor, evil or good.
	</p>
	<p>
		Remember, death is but only a part of life. That how without death, of those before us - our lives simply could not have been possible.<br>
		Learn and understand.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let not its fear - not let you live.
	</p>
	<p>
		Organ donation should be promoted.<br>
		Recycling one's dead body should be done in the most environment friendly way; One that has the smallest footprint and gives back to the world.
