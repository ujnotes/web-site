		Theism
		<p>
			All religions seek to emphasize the non-significance of an individual over that of the society.<br>
			That no matter how great you become, no matter how special you are you will not be the special ‘one’. You can never be God.<br>
			<br>
			Few understand the true meaning of what is preached and see beyond the symbolism. The rest get lost in the abstractions and the rituals.
			We are all plagued with the thought of being special. That our lives has to have a higher calling a special meaning.
