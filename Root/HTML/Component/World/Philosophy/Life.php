	<h3>
		What is life?
	</h3>
	<p>
		Life is more a song, a dance than a journey. There's not a 'destiny' per se.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you had everything like all the food, clothes, jewelry, and there was no one else, not a single other person, can you imagine how empty your life would be.<br>
		What would be the use of any fancy possession, your most fancy selfie ?
	</p>
	<p>
		Just like your body is a part of 'you' and is not exactly you, you are a part of something larger.<br>
		Just as an organ of your body by itself alone does not amount to much, you alone do not amount to much.<br>
		You leverage a lot from the society you live in. And so you also have an obligation, a responsibility.
	</p>
	<h3>
		How is life best lived?
	</h3>
	<p>
		Be nice, be awesome. Be selfless not selfish. Remember that you are not the centre of the universe.<br>
		Be of help in the good deeds of others and help 'life' itself. Live free, learn to learn and learn.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		And once you understand - have no fear. Choose your song and dance your best to it.
	</p>
