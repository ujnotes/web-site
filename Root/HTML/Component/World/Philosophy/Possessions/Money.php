		Money - is only a certificate - of how much (of help) the society owes you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Imagine A - is a farmer who grows Apples. B - is a Blacksmith and C - is a Cobbler.
		Now C is hungry - he walks up to A and asks for an Apple (C is in fact seeking a 'help' from A).<br>
		A is more than glad to help but he wishes to have a knife. at the exact same-time B's sandals are broken.<br>
		So C could fix B's sandals take a knife from him in return then walk up to A and exchange the knife for an apple. Everyone happy for all get what they need.
	</p>
	<p>
		But in real world - things don't happen simultaneously and at the same place.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a large and complex society - most often the party from whom we seek a service or a product from, does not seek a product or service directly in exchange from us.
	</p>
	<p>
		So the solution is to device a certificate that is a token - representing how much - of a common - standard unit, the society (here union of A, B & C) owes an individual.
