	<h3>
		What is a problem?
	</h3>
	<p>
		A matter or situation that is impeding or harmful and thus needing to be resolved.
	</p>
	<h3>
		The problems of this world:
	</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Ignorance and stupidity of man</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Things like crime, poverty, hunger, cruelty towards animal and environmental destruction are mostly but a consequence of this one problem.<br>
		And the rest, like cancer and death are only 'realities'. If curable, defeating them are only 'tasks' to be accomplished.<br>
		Which again are impeded by that one problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		&ldquo;.. Except for the uncontrolled and misguided mind, there is no enemy within this world ..&rdquo;<br>
		&nbsp; &mdash; <a class='content-link' href="http://gitabase.com/eng/SB/7/8/9" target='_blank'>Gita:7.8.9</a> (a book written by men, like EVERY other book)
	</p>
	<p>
		This gives rise to and is even further compounded with a greater peril of the "<strong>illusion of knowledge</strong>".<br>
		Which further shuts down an afflicted mind from any possibility of letting the right knowledge get in.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Man, by his nature seeks to control and thus dominate what is around him.<br>
		And so, many simply 'like' to discriminate and kill.<br>
		Now that our civilization is thousands of years old, we already have the knowledge, the resources and the tools.<br>
		Yet man wants to remain selfish even though it is understood, how futile and limited his personal life is.<br>
		Because of this, he continues to 'waste' his life on trivial things; Often hurting others on his way.<br>
		Due to his hunger for 'more' and his eccentricity, that wanting of being 'special' - he is readily sold to irrational ideas.<br>
		He thus then often subscribes to the idea of a personal 'god', that 'cares' about him 'personally'.<br>
		Racism and sectarianism rise from the same selfish craving of wanting to stand above the rest and dominate.<br>
		The structure of our societies and its economy exploit and thus promote this eccentric behavior.<br>
		While morality is often compromised over personal gains, life is reduced to "sell and buy", then "show and throw" - and its repetition.<br>
		At the level of sects, races and then countries this eccentricity continues and periodically results in eruptions of violence.<br>
		Even to this day, world peace dangles precariously on the prospect of mutually assured destruction.<br>
		<br>
		All because man refuses to learn and embrace what has already been learnt.<br>
		Primarily because he becomes comfortable in the lies he has been fed with.
