		Why are so many people killed in these senseless acts of violence?
	</p>
	<p>
		I will attempt to answer that question.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let me begin by putting forth this question: How do you shorten a line without even touching it?<br>
		Simple: just draw a longer line beside it. Similarly you could make a line longer by drawing a shorter line beside it.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the very core of us - is our innate nature to excel, to be ‘better’. This is intertwined with our social framework, reproductive behavior and evolution. Is what has brought us so far. Unfortunately, often humans take a shortcut to this. As many do not want to work hard to become better when there is such an easy way of just downsizing others.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example: Some people believe they are better just because they are white and black people are all bad. They are better because they are straight and all gay people are bad. They are better because they are bla bla and you are blue blue. Bottom line: better, special, standing out from the rest of the crowd.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then there’s another innate nature of humans at play. We try to identify the cause of all processes. More vigorously if it's a chronic problem. We have yet another flaw where in we end up over simplifying. In other words, especially the uneducated ones, are disposed to simply put a blame. For example: a boy in a village falling sick and the subsequent persecutions of a so called witch.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then we need to rid our minds from forming these groups ‘white’ ‘american’ ‘french’ ‘straight’ etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		Violence is wrong, with the exception of the requried compulsive defence of the greater lives in danger.
