    The violent path
  </p>
	<p>
		The terrorists, suffer gravely with the two flaws of the human mind.
		<ol>
			<li>
				I am holier than you.
			</li>
			<li>
				There is a better life after death.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		Deprived, without good education the only way they are left to make themselves ‘better’ is by buying into this vague idea, a fantasy, Going by the previous “lines” example they believe that are ‘better’ simply because the rest of the world is ‘evil’. that there is a personal god asking them to serve him by taking lives of fellow humans innocent or not, young or old, boy or a girl;
	</p>
	<p>
		This in a second elevates them above the rest of the world without having to do some real hard work like say building a bride other than mindlessly repeating a disjunct ritual.
		Additionally some are led to believe that the cause of all there suffering is to be attributed solely to a particular sect of people. Over simplification of the complex socio economic and geopolitical events.
	</p>
	<h5>Role of religion</h5>
	<p>
		Burdened by these thoughts by the end they are left with no more ‘interesting’ activity they could occupy themselves with.
		Ultimately they proceed on the easiest loudest path, that of violence, one which we humans are effortlessly good at. As it has stayed with us the longest since the early times when we were just animals.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now just like people associate with their sports clubs some have a religion, a cool higher brand to draw coolness from. The terrorists would have very occluded and obtuse, if any understanding of the religion. Due to whatever reason just like the Americans decided to drive on the right lane and every new american will be driving right.
	</p>
	<p>
		What is the solution?
		Unfortunately some of these will forever be present. That’s just how nature works. There will be very good people willing to even sacrifice their lives for the greater good of others walking on the path of nonviolence like Gandhi and Buddha. And at the same time there will be people like Hitler and these terrorists. But I also believe, there number will be gradually decreasing due to greater reach of technology and the consequential equalization of more and more population in terms of economy, human rights and education.

	<p>
		Darkness does not equal light. Darkness is nothing just the mere absence of light. And so ‘bad’ and ‘good’ are not equal. How ever hard darkness tries its gonna die out in the presence of light. A global brotherhood where there is more love, where everyone cares about everyone and is willing to sacrifice for the other - that will kill terrorism.
	</p>
	<p>
		What is needed is greater co-operation and the warranted sacrifice required from all of us towards making every piece of this planet better.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are all plagued with the thought of being special. That our lives has to have a higher calling a special meaning. Well we are special - we are.. just that we are all special!
