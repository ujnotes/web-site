	We are nature's creations and thus its part. War is simple - codified in nature itself. It is much like two bulls fighting for a mate. Only this time a 'bull' is a group of people - like a 'country'. Nature needed it. It does not need it any more. We are getting late! - we need to get our shit together before it kills us much like an "appendicitis". War is obsolete!
