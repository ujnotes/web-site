If curable they are only 'tasks' to be accomplished.<br> Which again are impeded by the first problem. <\/p> <h3> And so: <\/h3> <p> Man, by his nature seeks to control and thus dominate what is around him.<br> And so, many simply 'like' to discriminate and kill.<br> Now that our civilization is thousands of years old, we already have the knowledge, the resources and the tools.<br> Yet man wants to remain selfish even though it is understood, how futile and limited his personal life is.<br> Because of this, he continues to 'waste' his life on trivial things; Often hurting others on his way.<br> Due to his hunger for 'more' and his eccentricity, that wanting of being 'special' - he is readily sold to irrational ideas.<br> He thus often subscribes to the idea of a personal 'god' that 'cares' about him 'personally'.<br> Racism and sectarianism rise from the same selfish craving of wanting to stand above the rest and dominate.<br> The structure of our societies and its economy exploit and thus promote this eccentric behavior.<br> While morality is often compromised over personal gains, life is reduced to sell and buy then show and throw and its repetition.<br> At the level of sects, races and then countries this eccentricity continues and periodically result in eruptions of violence.<br> Even to this day, world peace dangles precariously on the prospect of mutually assured destruction.<br> <br> All because man refuses to learn and embrace what has already been learnt. <p> <\/div> <div class='center' id='content-body-separator'><\/div> <div id='sub-list' class='center page-list'> <\/div> <div id='fb_components'> <div class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"https:\/\/ujnotes.com\/world\/philosophy\/problem\" data-numposts=\"50\"> <\/div> <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"https:\/\/ujnotes.com\/world\/philosophy\/problem\" data-layout=\"button\" data-action=\"like\" data-size=\"small\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-share=\"true\"> <\/div> <\/div> <div id='nav-list' class='center page-list'> <a id='nav-menu-prev' class='item_block-disabled sidebar-nav-norm sidebar-nav-l-1'> &nbsp; <\/a><a id='nav-menu-next' class='XURL item_block_container' href='\/world\/philosophy\/solution' data-target='world\/philosophy\/solution' data-title='Solution'> <img class='item_block_image item_block_image_visible' src='\/world\/philosophy\/solution\/index.jpg' alt='Navigation - next page tile'><div class='item_block_text'><div>Solution<\/div><div class='arrow'>&#x25B7;<\/div><\/div> <\/a><a id='nav-menu-up' class='XURL item_block_container ' href='\/world\/philosophy' data-target='world\/philosophy' data-title='Philosophy'> <img class='item_block_image ' src='\/world\/philosophy\/index.jpg ' alt='Navigation - up level tile'><div class='item_block_text'><div>Philosophy<\/div><div class='arrow'>&#x25B3;<\/div><\/div> <\/a> <\/div>"}
