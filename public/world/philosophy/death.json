It dynamically maintains the delicate relationships of the ecosystem<br> If only we were to control our population growth rate, we could turn around the environmental destruction of our mother planet within a century. <\/p> <h3> Post death <\/h3> <p> After death, personally nothing special happens. It is quite like taking off the battery from a toy.<br> The 'false' idea of a personal afterlife is born from the human instinct of wanting to live at 'any' cost.<br> In order to support this fallacy many subscribe to the next fallacy of the existence of a heaven and a personal god that overlooks this entire affair. <\/P> <p> Seeking to have a personal legacy even after death, is indeed one of mans' most ludicrous idea.<br> The only legacy that a person should have, should be an impersonal one that inspires the future generation to goodness.<br> Recycling one's dead body should be done in the most environment friendly way that has the smallest footprint and gives back to the world.<br> Organ donation should be considered. <\/p> <h3> And so: <\/h3> <p> Death teaches us the futility of material possessions and self-centeredness.<br> It is also something that we share with the rest of the world. Trees die, animals die just as us humans. <\/p> <p> Remember, death is but only a part of life.<br> Learn and understand. Let not its fear - not let you live. <\/p> <\/div> <div class='center' id='content-body-separator'><\/div> <div id='sub-list' class='center page-list'> <\/div> <div id='fb_components'> <div class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"https:\/\/ujnotes.com\/world\/philosophy\/death\" data-numposts=\"50\"> <\/div> <div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"https:\/\/ujnotes.com\/world\/philosophy\/death\" data-layout=\"button\" data-action=\"like\" data-size=\"small\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-share=\"true\"> <\/div> <\/div> <div id='nav-list' class='center page-list'> <a id='nav-menu-prev' class='XURL item_block_container' href='\/world\/philosophy\/life' data-target='world\/philosophy\/life' data-title='Life'> <img class='item_block_image item_block_image_visible' src='\/world\/philosophy\/life.jpg' alt='Navigation - previous page tile'><div class='item_block_text'><div class='arrow'>&#x25C1;<\/div><div>Life<\/div><\/div> <\/a><a id='nav-menu-next' class='XURL item_block_container' href='\/world\/philosophy\/god' data-target='world\/philosophy\/god' data-title='God'> <img class='item_block_image item_block_image_visible' src='\/world\/philosophy\/god\/index.jpg' alt='Navigation - next page tile'><div class='item_block_text'><div>God<\/div><div class='arrow'>&#x25B7;<\/div><\/div> <\/a><a id='nav-menu-up' class='XURL item_block_container ' href='\/world\/philosophy' data-target='world\/philosophy' data-title='Philosophy'> <img class='item_block_image ' src='\/world\/philosophy\/index.jpg ' alt='Navigation - up level tile'><div class='item_block_text'><div>Philosophy<\/div><div class='arrow'>&#x25B3;<\/div><\/div> <\/a> <\/div>"}
